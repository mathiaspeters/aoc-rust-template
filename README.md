# aoc-rust-template

This project is an empty template for doing AdventOfCode in Rust. 

For each day you want to solve, add the input to the appropriate file in the `input` folder, add your solution to the appropriate file and function in `src`, and finally run using one of the scripts. For powershell run `./run.ps1 -Day <the day you want to run>` and for bash run `/run.sh <the day you want to run>`.
